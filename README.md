# Python Programs: Even/Odd Checker & Sum of integer from 1 to 50

This repository contains two simple Python scripts that demonstrate basic use of user input, conditionals, and loops.

## ðŸ“„ Files Included

1. **Task 1_Even_or_Odd.py**  
   A Python program that:
   - Takes an integer input from the user.
   - Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
   - Displays the result accordingly.

2. **Task 2_Sum_of_Integers_from_1_to_50_Using_a_Loop.py**  
   A Python program that:
   - Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
   - Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
   - Displays the final result.

## âœ… How to Run the Programs

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (version 3.x recommended).

Then, run the scripts using the command line or any Python IDE:

```bash
python Task_1_Even_or_Odd.py
python Task_2_Sum_of_Integers_from_1_to_50_Using_a_Loop.py
